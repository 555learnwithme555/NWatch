Arduino stuff

Alarm snooze
Options for alarm snooze
Improve alarms menu
	- Use new WE/TU icon things
Improve games menu
Options for setting what up and down buttons do when on the main watch display (open stopwatch/alarms/games etc)
Make menu option name animated, move off then back on or something
sleep mode options
	- Off
	- Low power (dim screen)
Reduce CPU clock if animations are disabled (and at other times too?)
Update the display less often (saves power)
	- Only draw when needed
	- Seperate logic and drawing
Sometimes the sounder 'pops' due to bad waveform output
Options for LEDs (brightness etc)
Fancy USB plugged in screen anim?
Countdown timer
More games?

Finish support for 12 hour time
Finish support for DS1307, MCP7940x and internal RTC sources
Finish support for LED flash patterns
If nothing else is using IO stuff (buzzer, LEDs) then use power save sleep instead of idle sleep (Timer2 can wakeup from power save sleep, even when not using async clock source!)
Something to show sunrise and sunset times? User will need to enter their latitude.
Record time of USB unplug

	- Initial release

2014-06-28:
	Software:
	- Added a bootloader (slightly modified Optiboot, added support for ATmega328 non-P and reading/writing EEPROM)
	- Reduced flash and RAM usage (Flash: 29156 -> 26702 (2454), RAM: 1407 -> 1300 (107))
	- Added support for playing tunes
	- Alarms are loaded from EEPROM as needed instead of having them hanging around in RAM all the time
	- Lots of bug fixes, heres some:
		Wonkiness if EEPROM wasn't programmed
		Alarms not going off on the correct day
		If an alarm goes off but is not cancelled by the user the watch would stay on
		Watch waking up when it's not supposed to
	- Bunch more stuff...

	Hardware (v1.3):
	- 3 Separate buttons instead of a 3 way nav button
	- MOSFETs have been changed to more suitable types (DMG6968s were total overkill)
	- Thinner PCB traces allowing components to be packed closer together
	- Breakout pads for power, I2C, UART and SPI
